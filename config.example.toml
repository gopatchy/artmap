# Address format:
#   from: universe[:channels]  - range specifies which channels to read
#   to:   universe[:channel]   - single channel specifies where to start writing
#
# From examples:
#   "0.0.1"        - all channels (1-512)
#   "0.0.1:50"     - channel 50 only
#   "0.0.1:50-"    - channels 50-512
#   "0.0.1:50-100" - channels 50-100
#
# To examples:
#   "0.0.1"        - starting at channel 1
#   "0.0.1:50"     - starting at channel 50
