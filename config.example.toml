# artmap configuration
# Run with: go run . -config config.toml [-listen :6454] [-broadcast 2.255.255.255]

# Address format:
#   from: universe[:channels]  - range specifies which channels to read
#   to:   universe[:channel]   - single channel specifies where to start writing
#
# Universe: "net.subnet.universe" or plain number (all 0-indexed, 0-127.0-15.0-15)
# Channels: 1-indexed (1-512), matching DMX convention
#
# From examples:
#   "0.0.1"        - universe 1, all channels (1-512)
#   "0.0.1:50"     - universe 1, channel 50 only
#   "0.0.1:50-"    - universe 1, channels 50-512
#   "0.0.1:50-100" - universe 1, channels 50-100
#   1              - universe 1, all channels
#   "1:50-100"     - universe 1, channels 50-100
#
# To examples:
#   "0.0.1"        - universe 1, starting at channel 1
#   "0.0.1:50"     - universe 1, starting at channel 50

# Output protocol (optional, default "artnet"):
#   proto = "artnet"  - output via ArtNet (broadcast or discovered nodes)
